# e7s read me
I have two profiles available for e7s, the first one is just normal reactions. The second file available contains my normal reactions and contains assist toggles slightly before Away With Thee goes off, allowing you to position for the teleports. Both of them work fine, it's up to you for which one you'd like to use.

If you're using the reactions that has assist toggling for Away With Thee, you have the option of removing the assist toggles for the third Away With Thee, doing this means you have to pre-position around the monster, the bonus is that you can keep doing damage until the stun goes out. To remove, find the third Away With Thee at 264.3 seconds on the timeline and then right click and Delete *only* the reactions named "disable assist before teleport" and "reenable assist once stunned/dead".

# e8s read me
If you're using the e8s profile listed above, make sure you are doing right side adds, if you're doing left side adds, you'll need to look for the file posted by the user 'The' in the discord "#files" channel on Rikudou's discord.

One more thing is that there is a toggle off for wildfire near the end of the fight, which is later turned back on when raid buffs are up. When this is most optimal is based on *your* static. You'll have to talk about when you want everybody to burst with your group. Some groups do it immediately after the akh rhai/ice slide, some groups do it after the final wyrm's lament. Based on your group, you'll have to move the reaction "reenable cd/pot" that's currently on "722.9 - Akh Rhai" to your desired location. Just copy the current reaction to where ever you want and delete the old one.
