# Discontinued
Discontinued my reactions until further notice, expect something in the future. Check Rikudou's discord to get replacement reactions in the meantime from user 'The', their reactions are the most up to date.

I've left up my version of The's e8s machinist reaction with right side adds. Everything outside of the adds phase is outdated, but if you want to copy over the reactions from the adds phase, you can download that and copy it over.

# Machinist
My machinist reactions aim to maximize uptime and not waste a single GCD. I've personally managed high parses with zero fight interaction and only using my own reactions. Some people have hit 99s, and allegedly, 100s. Right now they don't aim to align with raid buffs or anything like that to get the fastest boss burn, but they do aim to get you the highest rdps possible. Along with this, there's many other key features like arm's length usage, tactician, boss retargeting, etc.. That said, any feedback is appreciated and can be left on rikudou's discord for me. 

# Bard
My bard reactions are much more simple, as I'm not entirely interested in bard, and the class is overall a lot easier. Couple that with the fact that there isn't much demand for bard reactions and that's my justification to not spend as much time improving these. That said, you'll still get some basic functionality, troubador usage, arm's length usage, disabling battle voice before key mechanics to maximize uptime, and boss retargeting after the boss becomes targetable. 

# e7s read me
I have two profiles available for e7s, the first one is just normal reactions. The second file available contains my normal reactions and contains assist toggles slightly before Away With Thee goes off, allowing you to position for the teleports. Both of them work fine, it's up to you for which one you'd like to use.

If you're using the reactions that has assist toggling for Away With Thee, you have the option of removing the assist toggles for the third Away With Thee, doing this means you have to pre-position around the monster, the bonus is that you can keep doing damage until the stun goes out. To remove, find the third Away With Thee at 264.3 seconds on the timeline and then right click and Delete *only* the reactions named "disable assist before teleport" and "reenable assist once stunned/dead".

# e8s read me
If you're using the e8s profile listed above, make sure you are doing right side adds, if you're doing left side adds, you'll need to look for the file posted by the user 'The' in the discord "#files" channel on Rikudou's discord.

One more thing is that there is a toggle off for wildfire near the end of the fight, which is later turned back on when raid buffs are up. When this is most optimal is based on *your* static. You'll have to talk about when you want everybody to burst with your group. Some groups do it immediately after the akh rhai/ice slide, some groups do it after the final wyrm's lament. Based on your group, you'll have to move the reaction "reenable cd/pot" that's currently on "722.9 - Akh Rhai" to your desired location. Just copy the current reaction to where ever you want and delete the old one.

# FAQ
**Q: Where do I place these?**

A: MINIONAPP\Bots\FFXIVMinion64\LuaMods\TensorReactions\TimelineTriggers

**Q: My reactions aren't working?**

A: To be safe, after placing these files in the above folder, reload your LUA, then go to the TensorReactions menu, while on the respective class select each raid and make sure the profile for the class you're on is selected. If you're on machinist, select the machinist profiles, the next time you load into that raid on machinist, that profile will load. If you're having any issues beyond this, ask for help in rikudou's discord.
