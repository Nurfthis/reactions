Discontinued my machinist reactions until further notice, expect more diverse stuff in the future. Check Rikudou's discord to get replacement machinist reactions in the meantime from user 'The', their reactions are the most up to date.

I'm leaving up the machinist e8s right side adds profile, it's the exact same as The's profile outside of being optimized for the right side of adds phase. It'll still do the same optimization for getting out of adds phase with 100/100 guage, so make sure to disable those if your group is struggling with adds.


# e8s read me
Make sure you're downloading the version of e8s that fits which side of adds phase you'll be doing. Outside of adds phase, they are the exact same profiles.

Most of the timings are from The's profiles, so there shouldn't be much difference in changing between the machinist and bard profiles, outside of actually working for the respective class. Thank you 'The'.

# FAQ
**Q: Where do I place these?**

A: MINIONAPP\Bots\FFXIVMinion64\LuaMods\TensorReactions\TimelineTriggers

**Q: My reactions aren't working?**

A: To be safe, after placing these files in the above folder, reload your LUA, then go to the TensorReactions menu, while on the respective class select each raid and make sure the profile for the class you're on is selected. If you're on machinist, select the machinist profiles, the next time you load into that raid on machinist, that profile will load. If you're having any issues beyond this, ask for help in rikudou's discord.

**Q: How do I download these?**

A: Look for the button on the top right of this page called "Clone or download", click that and then "Download ZIP".
