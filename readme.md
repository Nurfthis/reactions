These fights all use custom potion timing, if you don't want to waste pots while progging these fights, either stash your potions in your chocobo saddlebag or disable the reactions.

There is an option to disable assist 3 seconds before the teleports go out for Away With Thee, but they are disabled by default. Search for Away With Thee and enable all of these reactions to make it work. You also have the option to changing the timer to a lower number, but this depends on your ping. So adjust as you are comfortable.

Make sure you're downloading the version of e8s that fits which side of adds phase you'll be doing. Outside of adds phase, they are the exact same profiles.

Most of the timings are from The's profiles, so there shouldn't be much difference in changing between the machinist and bard profiles, outside of actually working for the respective class. Thank you 'The'.

If you are doing the uptime strat for knockback mirrors, go to "535.1 - Reflected Wings (G)" on the timeline and check the box "Enabled" on the top right corner for ALL THREE reactions, ie 'disable assist', 'arm's length', and 'reenable assist'. This should work fully automated. If you have 30-100 ping, you can lower the timer offset to "-1.200" for safer usage. If you have above 180 ping, you can make it higher. I do not recommend going over -1.500. 

# FAQ
**Q: Where do I place the reactions?**

A: MINIONAPP\Bots\FFXIVMinion64\LuaMods\TensorReactions\TimelineTriggers

**Q: Where do I place dotblacklist.lua?**

A: MINIONAPP\Bots\FFXIVMinion64\LuaMods\TensorRequiem

**Q: My reactions aren't working?**

A: To be safe, after placing these files in the above folder, reload your LUA, then go to the TensorReactions menu, while on the respective class select each raid and make sure the profile for the class you're on is selected. If you're on machinist, select the machinist profiles, the next time you load into that raid on machinist, that profile will load. If you're having any issues beyond this, ask for help in rikudou's discord.

**Q: How do I download these?**

A: Look for the button on the top right of this page called "Clone or download", click that and then "Download ZIP".

**Q: Can you make reactions for X job?**

If you'd like me to work on reactions for another job, I'll first have to purchase the ACR. You can use the above link to donate money to me so that I can purchase the ACR and begin working on it. If you'd like the reactions to be as optimized as possible, you can spend more to allow me to purchase a jump potion on an alt and I'll dedicate an alt character entirely to raiding on that job to optimize the reactions in a live setting.
