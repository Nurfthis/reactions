# read me

Each fight contains "read me" reactions on the very first mechanic on the timeline. Make sure to read them for more information.

# FAQ
**Q: Where do I place the reactions?**

A: MINIONAPP\Bots\FFXIVMinion64\LuaMods\TensorReactions

**Q: My reactions aren't working?**

A: To be safe, after placing these files in the above folder, reload your LUA, then go to the TensorReactions menu, while on the respective class select each raid and make sure the profile for the class you're on is selected. If you're on machinist, select the machinist profiles, the next time you load into that raid on machinist, that profile will load. If you're having any issues beyond this, ask for help in rikudou's discord.

**Q: How do I download these?**

A: Look for the button on the top right of this page called "Clone or download", click that and then "Download ZIP".

**Q: Can you make reactions for X job?**

If you'd like me to work on reactions for another job, I'll first have to purchase the ACR. You can use the above link to donate money to me so that I can purchase the ACR and begin working on it. If you'd like the reactions to be as optimized as possible, you can spend more to allow me to purchase a jump potion on an alt and I'll dedicate an alt character entirely to raiding on that job to optimize the reactions in a live setting.
